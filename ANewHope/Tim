Bearing Assembly Numbers
In order to facilitate the identity of groups of parts, a "bearing as-
sembly number" system is used. AP bearings are each assigned
a five digit numeric code that follows the cone part number to
describe the individual component parts, prelubrication, perfor-
mance codes, and internal clearance of the pre-set assembly. In
                                                                                                                                               B
some cases the code may be alphanumeric, although the first digit
is always "9".

For new applications, an assembly number is assigned on receipt
of the first order. It is very important for the correct fitting and func-
tioning of the bearing that the same assembly number is quoted for
all subsequent replacement orders for that specific bearing posi-
tion. Standard and supplemental assembly numbers are listed in
this catalog starting on page 55.                                                             HM120848            90012   Backing Ring

Elevator Sheave
The cup of this AP bearing is mounted directly into the sheave hub
with a tight fit. Snap rings are required because of elevator safety
regulations.

No provision for relubrication is made in this application. Some
builders prefer to completely fill the bearing with grease at assem-
bly while others depend on the initial charge of grease as supplied
in a new bearing. Either practice is satisfactory for this specific
application.

Wood Pulp Beater Spindle
This beater spindle uses all standard parts of the AP bearing
unit with exception of the special housing (Fig. 22a and Fig. 22b).
A clearance can be provided between the faces of the cup and
housing shoulders to provide axial float as required. Note that this
design uses a split housing.

Furnace Wheel
This design takes advantage of the "package" portion of the AP
bearing-seal wear ring to seal wear ring. The use of both the
adapter and backing ring is eliminated. The end cap is applied af-
ter insertion of a special spacer backing against the seal wear ring
to clamp up the bearing assembly (Fig. 23).

Simplified Installation of AP Bearings For
Industrial Equipment

Installation Methods
What does the operator of a machine do when the operator's ma-
chine, located in a remote area away from any sophisticated tools,
needs a bearing replaced? Timken suggests using the following                                                 Pressure Piston Pump
procedures for installing AP bearings when sophisticated tools                                                1 14 in. Nut
are not available. These methods for installing AP bearings are
                                                                                                              Pressure Piston/Ram
valuable ways of saving time and money.

Unlike other tapered roller bearing installations where the individ-
ual components are installed separately, the complete AP bearing
assembly should be installed at the same time.


Hydraulic RAM Method
One method of installation utilizes a pressure piston pump and ram
in an arrangement as shown at right.

The 445 kilonewton (50 ton) capacity centerhole hydraulic ram is
                                                                                                                                     D
used for the Class D (5 12 x 10) bearing.

One of the least expensive tooling arrangements for installing our
AP bearing utilizes the tools shown in Fig. 27.

    HOW TO ORDER

    Basic AP Bearing Ordering Procedure
    To facilitate order entry, identify the bearing assembly and required
    auxiliary parts by specifying the following details from the tables
    shown on pages 53 and 54. Also specify the quantity of each sub-
    assembly required to make up the assembly to suit your applica-
    tion. See page 13 for a detailed explanation of assembly numbers.


    An AP bearing assembly consists of:
    **Basic AP assembly, does not include end cap (page 53)
    **End cap - one per bearing (page 54)
    **Backing spacer - one per bearing (page 54) with (choose one                  Lubricant fitting             Vent fitting
      per bearing):
      ** pipe plug
      ** or lubricant fitting
      ** or vent fitting

    Examples

    1. A Class D assembly with shroud and pressed backing
    ring includes the following part numbers to order:
    **HM127446 90012 AP bearing assembly with shroud (page 53)
E   **K85521 90011 axle end cap assembly - one per bearing (page 54)

                                                                            Fig. 31 Cross section view of AP bearing with shroud

    2. A Class D assembly with auxiliary parts includes the
    following part numbers to order:
    **HM127446 90048 basic AP bearing assembly (page 53)
    **K85521 90011 axle end cap assembly - one per bearing (page 54)

    Auxiliary Parts
    Auxiliary parts may be added to basic AP bearings, as required.

    NOTE: Provide for relubrication on one side of bearing with vent at opposite side. If an auxiliary part is not used, these provisions should
    be made in parts adjacent to the bearing.
